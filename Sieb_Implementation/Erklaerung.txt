Initialization:

Set the number to be checked (r0) to 29.
Set the divisor (r1) to 2.
First Iteration:

Compare the divisor (2) with the number (29).
Since 2 < 29, enter the loop.
Divide 29 by 2 (sdiv r2, r2, r1). The quotient is 14, and the remainder is 1.
Multiply the quotient (14) by the divisor (2). The result is 28.
Compare the result (28) with the original number (29). They are not equal, so continue to the next iteration.
Second Iteration:

Increment the divisor to 3.
Compare the divisor (3) with the number (29).
Since 3 < 29, enter the loop.
Divide 29 by 3 (sdiv r2, r2, r1). The quotient is 9, and the remainder is 2.
Multiply the quotient (9) by the divisor (3). The result is 27.
Compare the result (27) with the original number (29). They are not equal, so continue to the next iteration.
Third Iteration:

Increment the divisor to 4.
Compare the divisor (4) with the number (29).
Since 4 < 29, enter the loop.
Divide 29 by 4 (sdiv r2, r2, r1). The quotient is 7, and the remainder is 1.
Multiply the quotient (7) by the divisor (4). The result is 28.
Compare the result (28) with the original number (29). They are not equal, so continue to the next iteration.
Continue the Loop:

The loop continues with increments to the divisor until it exceeds the square root of 29.
End of Loop:

When the divisor exceeds the square root of 29, exit the loop.
Prime Check:

Since the loop completed without finding a divisor that evenly divides 29, it is considered prime.
Set the Z flag to indicate that the number is prime (movs r0, r0).
End of Program:

The program ends.
